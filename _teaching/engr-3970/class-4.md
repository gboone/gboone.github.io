## Goals for the day

* Understand Kuhn's idea of scientific revolutions.
* Understand how controversy works to coerce scientific communities for better or worse

--

## Kuhn: Science is what scientists do

* Long periods of normal science are punctuated by revolution
* Scientists operate under a shared paradigm
  * Recognition of past success
  * Beliefs about which theories are right
  * Understanding of important problems in the field and methods for solving them

---

## Examples of paradigms:

* Newtonian physics
* Lavoisier's chemistry
* Medelian genetics

---

## What do paradigms do?

* Paradigms are a worldview
  * Categories and frameworks for phenomena
  * Patterns of behavior and frameworks for action
  * Scientists and technologists work creatively within the paradigm; puzzle solving

---

## Normal Science

* Scientists socialize each other around the paradigm; it's not open to serious question
  * Trained to understand the paradigm by solving well-understood, well-structured problems
  * Failure to solve a problem lies with the scientist, not the worldview
* Did Newton include everything there was to know about gravity in _Pincipia?_ No!
  * Cavendish Experiments were the first to measure G 110 years after Principia was published; 69 years after it was first published in English
  * The "Newtonian Paradigm" suggested there should be a constant for G but it took 110 years to begin figuring out what it was

---

## Crisis

* Paradigms can only represent a partial view of the world
* Unsolved problems are anomalies, work for future research
  * Accumulation of anomalies might turn into real problems for the paradigm
  * Threats to the paradigm allow scientists to begin to see new ideas or ways of thinking about their field
  * If an alternative starts to answer some of those problems, it might start a new era of "normal science"

---

## Revolutions build and destroy

* Science doesn't generate truth, it generates worldviews that contain truth for people who can understand them
* Revolutions cause people to stop seeing one way and start seeing another
* Past research can seem bizarre, and if it isn't seen that way, something is wrong with the paradigm â€” they are incommensurable
  * The proponents of competing paradigms "practice their trades in different worlds"
  * Kuhn moderated on this later
* What kind of conversations would be difficult for a physicist or engineer who doesn't understand Special Relativity

---

## Boundaries and translation

* As people from different areas of society interact, science develops unity
* "Pidgin" languages let scientists communicate across disciplines
* Boundary objects stand in for language to coordinate across boundaries without translation
  * Standardized records
  * Museums
* Boundary objects are opportunities to give outsiders an in to the paradigm, to understand it and become indoctrinated

## Controversy or, how the anti-cyclists do it
