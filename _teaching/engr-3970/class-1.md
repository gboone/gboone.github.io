## Fish bowl (2 minutes)

Write down any questions you had about the text and give them to me. (In the future you could also email them to me.) We'll come back to these at the end of the class and

---

## Goal of the day

* Understand different theories of how knowledge is created (also called epistemology)
* Understand why scientific and engineering communities should be studied, and how.

---

## How is knowledge created

Epistemology exercise. Speed dating
* Line up in even rows facing each other
* What is science?
* What is pseudo-science?
* What makes a fact a fact?
* How are facts created?
* How are facts challenged?
* Why are facts important for entrepreneurs?

---

### Positivism: Knowledge creation works by collecting observations that support the same theory.
  * Build enough observations and you can start to make predictions
  * People publish giant books to make a relatively straightforward theory
  * Problems:
    * Theories are too abstract
    * Duplicative work (Copernicus vs. Ptolemy)

---

### Falsification: Knowledge is created when risky theories make (all) the right predictions
  * Close to the scientific method: Stake out a theory, prove it with data, repeat
  * Requires _a lot_ of assumptions
  * what happens when you're _really sure_ about your theory but the data don't agree.
  * No theory can explain everything; we should be suspicious of any that do (Marxism, Phrenology, Freudianism)

---
### Duhem-Quine Hypothesis: Theories can't be perfectly tested therefore the underlying belief system must remain consistent.
  * Focus on the consistency of an underlying belief system
  * Too many variables at play in scientific work to let one failed prediction derail an entire theory
  * (Newton, gravity, and the moon)

---

### Realism: Science progresses toward and accumulates truth
  * Tools and methods are constantly improving
  * We can only make better predictions and build technology because we know more things to be true
  * Falsified theories are eventually discarded but only in favor of ones that better support truth
  * Formal methods ensure progress continues
  * Expulsion of Pluto from the ranks of "planets"

---

### Functionalism: Science certifies knowledge
  * People are not scientific, they are disciplined.
  * Formalized methods and practice create institutions, individuals within those institutions do work
  * Good behavior (following the method) is rewarded; bad behavior is penalized
  * Peril: When the institutions fail.
    * Peer review (2015 psychology controversy)

---

## How does science work?
* Science has authority
* Theories, observations, and predictions are all related to the creation of knowledge
* Formalism give those things power in different ways

---

## Science is a formal activity that creates knowledge by directly confronting the natural world.

* Every discipline has a different, and very clearly articulated, statement of epistemology â€” how they believe knowledge is created in their discipline

---

## Card sort
Split the board into sections for positivim, falsification, realism, Duhem-Quine, and Functionalism

All discoveries create knowledge. Given these five frameworks for how that works:
* Write down one to three theories that underly your work and, based on what you know about them, place them near the type of knowledge creation that went into them.
* There's no wrong answer here, but you will have to defend your answer
* Think broadly, everything from Newton and Einstein to smaller or more recent discoveries

## What is technology?

Small groups, come up with your own answer to this question.
* Have a 5-8 word answer but be able to elaborate on it
Each group shares their answer
* Write it on the board
* Briefly explain it

---

### Techne

Greek root of the word "technology," means art, craft, craftsmanship

---

### Applied science

* Science makes the discoveries
* Technology makes things based on them
* Scientific determinism

---

### Lewis Mumford

* Humans act in the context of the technology available to them
* Polytechnics: small machines for achieving routine goals
* Monotechnics: large machines with tremendous power that require disciplined operation often to a dehumanizing extent
* _Modern Times_ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPSK4zZtzLI
---

### Heidegger

* Application of science in service of power
* Technology produces resources; the world consists of resources to be turned into other resources
---

### Dewey

Two way street:
* Science is theoretical technology
* Technology is is applied science

---

### Technological determinism

* Technology makes our lives more efficient
* Increased efficiency causes innovation
* We are as efficient as we can possibly be right now

---

### Radical science

* William Gibson: "The future is here it's just not evenly distributed"
* _The Bulletin of Atomic Scientists_

## Science and technology studies

* A culmination of many thinkers coming together around some common ideas
* Science and technology are social activities
* Science is not simply an act of translating nature into knowledge
* Technology isn't simply translating knowledge into Artifacts
* Both are active processes that shape and are shaped by social action
* Both use the natural world in their work
