Introduce yourself to me in a letter. No need to write more than 1 double spaced page. Your letter should begin with a greeting, and end with you signing your name. Beyond that, I’m not concerned about formatting.

You may use some of the responses you included for your reflection questions, if they fit in with the questions below.

## Here's what to include in your letter

**At least two goals you have for yourself this semester.**

Try to describe at least one of them in specific terms.

**Two facts about yourself.**

List them clearly after your name, at the bottom of the letter. These should be facts that you don’t usually share within the first 20 minutes of meeting someone, but wouldn’t mind sharing with the class  (though keep them to yourself for now). These facts could be quirky, surprising, fun, or any other adjective you can come up with, but they must be true. For example, I could write at the bottom of my letter:

* I moved to Denver from Washington, DC in 2016.
* My day job is with a 18F, a tech consultancy in the federal government.

The rest is up to you. Feel free to include any details that you’d like me to know. If you need ideas, consider telling me about:
* Any information about you or your situation this semester that you’d like me to know
* Hometown, family, favorite pastime, current home.
* Academic interests, career aspirations, specific interests within engineering
* Thing you are concerned or excited about
* Learning preferences
* Any preferences for the personal pronouns you prefer to be addressed with that
you’d like me to know about. That means the pronoun that you use in reference to yourself. Here’s an example of someone talking about pronouns, “I’m Jenna and I like to be referred to with she, her, and hers pronouns.” So you could say, ‘she went to her car’ if you were talking about me.”
