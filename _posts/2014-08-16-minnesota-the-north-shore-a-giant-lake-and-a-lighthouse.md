Wedding Week part two began with a drive from Madison to Minneapolis followed by
another drive in the morning from Minneapolis to Castle Danger, [an
"unincorporated community in Silver Creek Township, MN"][1], nestled along the
shore of the world's largest freshwater lake, Lake Superior.<a href="#1" id="footnote_1_anchor">_(1)_</a>

Silver Creek is a short drive north from Two Harbors, MN where we stopped for a
bridal hair preview appointment. While Danielle was busy I gave myself a quick
tour of the city that birthed one of the world's most innovative companies, 3M.

By the time we made it to Castle Danger there was just enough light for a dinner
over last minute wedding planning. From the decks on our rooms we could see
infinite darkness stretching across the lake, and looking up countless stars
glimmering above. It was the first of what would turn out to be a phenomenally
beautiful weekend on Minnesota's North Shore.

The next morning we decided to go for a bike ride. The hotel rented bikes for
free and while none of them were bikes I would buy, they were suitable for the
20 mile ride to Split Rock Lighthouse and back. We headed out on the Gitchi-Gami
State Trail, a network of [29 complete miles of off-highway bike trail that will
one day connect Two Harbors and Grand Marais over 88 miles of bike trail][3].
From Gooseberry Falls onward we rode on one of the newest stretches of trail,
stopping along the way to pick agates, visit with boaters, and take in
magnificent views of the North Shore.

It had been at least 15 years since I was last at Split Rock Lighthouse, and had
forgotten its importance to the region. It was built in response to a series of
wrecks cause by a large storm that hit the lake in 1910 and was a large
motivator to extending the road that became Highway 61 up to Split Rock due to
its popularity as a tourist attraction. I have to say the station is something
to behold. While there we learned that it was built in such a precarious
location that all kinds of clever—and dangerous—methods were used to supply the
lighthouse and it's keepers with basic necessities before the road was built. If
you pay the admission you can climb the tower and get up close and personal with
its [Fresnel lens][5].

By the time we arrived back in Castle Danger, our guests were starting to
trickle in and the full wedding weekend really began.
