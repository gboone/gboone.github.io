## Welcome to ENGR 3790! (5 min) (6:05)

## About me

### My name is Greg Boone.

### This is my first time teaching at DU.

#### My past teaching includes:
* Georgetown University
* K-12 in Hungary
* 1-5 in South Korea

### I work for 18F: A tech consultancy in the federal government

## I believe design is a process of democratizing parts of society by building products that serve the needs of specific communities.

## Goals for this semester: (10 min) (6:45)

#### Part 1: Fundamentals of Science and Technology Studies
- Understand how historians, sociologists, economists, and political science study science and technology
- Immerse ourselves in an interdisciplinary experience
- Understand how professions and fields of study are established through practices and philosophies

#### Part 2: Product design and testing
- Understand three fundamental concepts of product development: accessibility, content design, and usability.
- Have a framework for applying these concepts to an engineering business
- Understand design as a process of serving users

#### Overall
- Understand how justice and democracy are embedded in and perpetuated by human-built technical systems
- Understand the power of engineering and scientific work and of social systems that sometimes conflict with this work

This class will be more like a typical humanities class than an engineering class.

There will be a lot of reading, writing, and in-class activities will involve discussing ideas outside your discipline.

## Assignments (10 minutes) (6:55)

### Readings

I'll try to keep the reading to a reasonable amount. They may be challenging to read at times. Our in-class time will be focused on understanding the arguments and how they relate to being a practicing engineer in your industry. Please come to class having read them and take ample notes. **Do not be shy about asking questions** and challenging the author's argument.

Class participation, including attendance and reading, will comprise 30% of your final grade.

### Weekly reflection essays

It's important that you understand the arguments made by these authors even if you don't agree with them 100%. For the first half of the term, you'll submit a short (no more than 500 words) essay reflecting on each week's readings and in-class discussions.

### Mid-term essay

Between the two halves of this course, you'll submit a longer essay (between 500 and 1000 words) bringing together the concepts in the first half of the class. This paper will be due at the beginning of class on May 1.

The reflection essays plus the mid-term will comprise 30% of your final grade.

### Final project

A final group project will be 40% of your final grade. I'll ask you and your group to choose a technology and take it out of it's black box. Apply the concepts at the beginning of the course to explain the socio-technical context of the artifact, and the concepts from later in the course to critique the artifact's design, and identify any social constructs it is either perpetuating or upsetting. More information about this to come later in the course, but start thinking about technologies you might pursue now.

## Break (10 min) (7:05)

---

## Discuss: Uber and Lyft drivers are failing black riders (30 min) (7:35)

* Get into groups of 2 or 3
* Read the article
* Discuss this question: How does this study challenge the notion that ridesharing companies are upending the status quo? How should designers, engineers, and scientists think about potential unintended consequences of their work? How might they mitigate them?
