Write down any questions you had about the text and give them to me. (In the future you could also email them to me.) We'll come back to these at the end of the class and

## Goal of the day

* Understand the foundational work behind the philosophy of science.
* Understand different theories of how science creates knowledge
* Understand why scientific and engineering communities should be studied, and how.

---

## Card sorting
Split the board into sections for positivim, falsification, realism, Duhem-Quine, and Functionalism

* Grab some post-its, write down different characteristics of each of the different theories and put them in the right part of the board.

## How does science work?

> Science is a formal activity that creates knowledge by directly confronting the natural world.

* Systematic methods that let the natural world develop theories
* Positivism: Individual observations accumulate and fit together into a comprehensive theory
  * What are some problems with this?
    * Theories are too abstract
    * Duplicative work: Copernican astronomy, for example
  * What are its strengths?
  * Where do we see positivism in modern science?
* Falsification and Karl Popper: "The best theories are the ones that make all the right predictions."
  * How can we draw a line between "science" and "non-science"?
  * A theory should not be able to explain everything.
  * Imaginative creations and "risky" predictions
  * Meaning not tied to observation, but to evaluation.
  * Problems with Falsification
    * "risky predictions" require assumptions, sometimes a lot of them
    * Scientists sometimes do exactly what Popper doesn't want: explain away incorrect predictions
  * Where do we see falsification in modern science?
* What do they have in common?
  * Relating theories to data; either building them on top of data, or letting data invalidate them
* Duhem-Quine: Theories themselves are never tested, rather a framework of beliefs is tested.
  * Allows a theory to be held as long as the framework remains consistent
  * Theories aren't created in a vacuum
  * False predictions could be because of the theory, the data, other hypotheses, or the measuring equipment
  * Many things can confound logical deduction
  * Example of Duhem-Quine in modern science? In your own work?
* Realism: Science progresses toward and accumulates truth
  * Tools and methods for measuring, observing, and making predictions always get better
  * Truth: We can only make more and better predictions and build technologies based on them, if there are more things we know to be true
  * Falsified theories are discarded in favor of ones that better support the truth
  * Formal methods are created to ensure truth accumulation continues apace
* Functionalism: Science certifies knowledge
  * Behavior that advances knowledge is awarded, other behaviors are penalized.
  * People are not scientific, they're disciplined
* Common thread: Science has authority because it has standards and norms governing behavior
* Technology
  * Often thought of as applied science
    * Interesting questions are about effects
    * This view of technology prevents ex-post invention: Discoveries arising out of technological creation
  * Mumford: Technology enables human action
    * Polytechnics: small-scale tools for achieving human goals
    * Monotechnics: large-scale machines with tremendous power but rely on disciplined operation
  * Heidegger: Tech is "the application of science in the service of power"
  * Dewey: All rational thought is instrumental; technology is applied science
  * Ellul: Society has the most efficient technology science will allow
* Science and Technology Studies: the merging of many interdisciplinary efforts around a common assumption, that science and technology are social activities.
  * Scientists and engineers have communities around them
  * Communities have specific practices
  * Communities set standards, rules for evaluating claims and creating things
  * There is a rhetorical purpose of always needing to persuade preferences
  * Actors have invested in their skills, knowledge and formal practices
  * Social problems in society can be mirrored within these communities
  * S&T are active processes that can be studied like any other
  * Scientists and engineers "_use_ the material world in their work," they're not merely translating it into knowledge and objects

## Break (10 min) (7:05)

---

## Discuss: Uber and Lyft drivers are failing black riders (30 min) (7:35)

* Get into groups of 2 or 3
* Read the article
* Discuss this question: How does this study challenge the notion that ridesharing companies are upending the status quo? How should designers, engineers, and scientists think about potential unintended consequences of their work? How might they mitigate them?
