If you've read this blog or follow me on social media you might already know that I wasn't a Trump supporter. I was raised to be suspicious of people who lied, cheated, and stole their way to the top. I was disgusted and terrified by the words he chose to use when talking about my fellow Americans from marginalized communities: People of color, LGBT people, the disabled, women, and especially Muslims. To me, most of his policy statements, in the rare event he gave one, rang as flippant and rooted in racist ideas about people's motives. What makes me most nervous is that we have no idea what to expect from him other than making America great again. We learned on the campaign trail that we can't trust the sincerity of anything he says. If he says something racist, he's just joking. If he says something sexist like how he "grabs [women] by the pussy," it's "just locker room talk." So is he serious about the wall? About banning Muslims from entering the country? About making immigrants walk around with special ID cards? We have no idea. I wasn't a Romney or McCain supporter in the last two elections, but at least we know what we were in for if they won.

I've been ruminating about what all of this unease means for me, my job, and my family these last few days. I think back on the first day I sat down in the event center at 1800 F Street to take my oath of office, and the pride I felt saying those words:

>I, Gregory Boone, do solemnly swear that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; that I take this obligation freely, without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion; and that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office on which I am about to enter. So help me God.

I never really thought I'd be able to serve the federal government. I'm not a scientist or engineer or a lawyer and the jobs I did qualify for seemed out of reach. Once I was there, despite feeling really lucky and proud to walk past his portrait every morning, I didn't really think of my job in terms of being an Obama Administration official. There were plenty of things I thought Obama was wrong about. Trade policy, abuse of intelligence agencies, even, to some extent healthcare. This nuance of working for the executive branch but not the president is important and difficult to grasp to those of us who are new to it. I've been leaning on the wisdom of others these last few days and a few things have come up.

[Susan Hennessey in the Lawfare blog talks about the ethics of serving in Trump's National Security Agency][1]. She served for several years and strongly believes that "an empowered intelligence community makes the world safer for people and ideas," and "whoever the President may be, it is a critical authority necessary to keep Americans safe." There are limits and bounds on that mission that are important for the health of our republic and we are part of the system of checks and balances. Therefore:

> "It is the duty of rational, reasonable experts to serve their country in a Trump administration, even at the political level, if asked. If he will accept it, Trump must have wise and informed counsel. Americans will be served by principled individuals in government defending our Constitution and role in the world. Those who stay home to satisfy ideals of personal integrity will not make our world safer."

This cuts at the core of the oath of office. We public servants, swore an oath of office to be the front line of defense between the administration and the people of this country. We were hired to put our skill and expertise to work for the American people and in service to the Constitution.

As Jen Pahlka, CEO of Code for America, [wrote this week][2], we need to continue to "do everything they can to serve [our] real bosses: the American public." Jen's thoughts, and [my colleague Noah Kunin's][3], touched closer to the work we we do at 18F. Even if some of us came to 18F because they were inspired by President Obama, we ultimately came driven by the principle that the government should work better for it's people.

At 18F we like to say we're taking back the term "good enough for government work," reclaiming it to mean we strive for the highest possible quality in everything we do. We can disagree with politicians about what government _should_ be doing, and those politicians will certainly tell us what that answer is for the next 4 years, but we're here to _do_. We're here to do well and do good.

So, like Noah Kunin, I'm staying. I'm staying because Jen Pahlka is right, this is a movement happening at every level of government here in the US and around the world. We get nowhere if we don't show up. I hoped I could serve the US government beyond my term, and I continue to hope for that.

I'm staying. I'm finishing my coffee.
