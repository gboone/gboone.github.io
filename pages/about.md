Welcome to my blog! My name is Greg Boone, I work for [18F](https://18f.gsa.gov) where I help manage the website and communications strategy. I grew up in Minnesota and have [lived in lots of places since]({{ site.baseurl }}/map/). In previous lives I was a [grad student at Georgetown University](https://cct.georgetown.edu), an [English teacher in Hungary](https://www.harmsboone.org/category/blog/keeping-up-with-the-magyars), and [South Korea](https://www.harmsboone.org/category/blog/korea), and a student at [Gustavus Adolphus College](http://gustavus.edu).

I love technology, travel, biking, and home brewing. I write mostly about that first one here. I'm particularly interested in how technologies and society interact and issues like privacy, hacktivism, and public service are particularly interesting. This blog is about learning new things, no matter where or what they are.
