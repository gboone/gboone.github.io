It's a big life change for me to add on to so many others lately. ([Did you hear I got married?][1]) On Monday I leave almost two years of work at Excella Consulting and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to take on the unique opportunity of changing the way government works from the inside out. [18F][2] is a fascinating agency that's been getting a lot of attention for its connections to the Presidential Innovation Fellowship (which it runs) and the newly formed [US Digital Service][3]. At 18F we're committed to working with other agencies to build high quality digital tools that disrupt the notion that government tech projects are long death marches that ultimately come up lackluster. Instead, 18F approaches government technical problems in a user-focused, agile way that will change the average citizen's experience interacting with their government.

Working with a team of talented individuals to create a more open, transparent, and accessible government is a cause close to my heart. I'm tremendously excited to get to work hacking our bureaucracy.
