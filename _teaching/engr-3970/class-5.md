## Assignments

* Reading response is due before class on Monday
* Readings for Monday: Bruno Latour, Karin Knorr-Cetina
* For Wednesday, 4/26: Choose a start-up technology company an analyze their product from the perspective of one of the readings we've had so far
  * Prepare a 5 minute presentation in class
  * Presentaiton should include:
    * An overview of the product
    * An overview of the theory you're using to analyze it and why you chose it
    * Apply the theory to the product: How might it change, or how might it change society based on

## Goals for the day

* Understand how dissent and controversy forced the scientific community into agreement over the cause of AIDS
* Be able to trace the social groups and individual scientists who pushed science into action
* Be able to use the HIV-AIDS example to explain how science becomes "settled."

Key terms:

Medical:
* Retrovirus, retrovirology: RNA Viruses that insert a DNA copy of their genome into the host cell; HIV is a retrovirus
* Epidemiology: the science of epidemics and public health
* Etiology: study of what causes diseases
* Pathology
* Viral oncogenes: viruses whose genes can cause cancer
* mycoplasma: small parasitic bacteria that can sometimes cause diseases

Scientific:
* Henle-Koch: Jakob Henle, 19th C physician & his student Robert Koch, discoverer of TB; Critera for validating something causes a disease
* "styles of practice": plurality of sciences and their attendant methods; ways of thinking plus "activities of hands and eyes and discourses between multiple actors. Historically located and collectively produced work processes, methods, and rules for verifying a theory.
  * Styles of practice are "self stabilizing" for the people who do scientific work; you need to understand the style of practice to understand what objectivity means

---

In your group, tell the story of the AIDS epidemic. 
* Who were the major characters?
* What were the major conflicts?
* How did styles of practice contribute to the conflicts?
* Why was this particular controversy so heated?
* How did epidemiologists determine HIV caused AIDS?
* How was Duesberg unable to see the problem the same way as the AIDS researchers?

Notes:

AIDS Deaths by year (CDC):
year | adult | child | total to date
-----+-------+-------+--------------------
1984 | 3473  | 52    | 6247 + 121  = 6368
1985 | 6877  | 119   | 11794 + 250 = 12044
1986 | 12016 | 167   | 19064 + 340 = 19404
1987 | 16194 | 294   | 28599 + 506 = 29105
1988 | 20922 | 322   | 35508 + 618 = 36126
1989 | 27680 | 374   | 42768 + 731 = 43499
1990 | 31436 | 814   | 48732 + 814 = 49546

HIV causes AIDS
April 1984: (Reagan Administration) Surgeon General Margaret Heckler, declares HIV -> Aids
* Peter Duesberg, noted cancer researcher, challenged validity of the study

Duesberg
* Expert in field of viruses that cause cancer
* Dissents in 1987
* HIV can't cause AIDS because the data about patients contradicted the theory; observations in the natural world â‰  predictions in the theory
* HIV cannot cause AIDS, in fact, it might not even be a virus at all
* Attacked the scientific community, offered to inject himself with HIV
* Feb. 1989: Duesberg publishes HIV and AIDS: Correlation but not Causation
  * Synthesis of data from different disciplines: virology, pathology, immunology, biochem, & epidemiology
  * Attack the evidence, offer a counter-argument
  * Borrowed the Henle-Koch; said HIV failed to meet the standard
  * Behaviors cause AIDS, not an "idle retrovirus"
* _Policy Review_ with Ellison
* _Biomedicine and Pharmacotherapy_ drug-AIDS theory matched to HIV-AIDS, with a claim of superiority

AIDS Researchers
* Ignored Duesberg; he's too wrong to warrant a response
* Publicizing his ideas are dangerous
* American Foundation for AIDS Research conference
  * April 1988, let's settle this once and for all
  * Harold Ginsburg, moderator, declared the paradoxes settled
  * Plenty of data exists to match Henle-Koch predictions
* Robert Gallo: NIH Retrovirologist who isolated HIV, primary basis for Heckler's declaration
* Blattner, Gallo, Temin respond in _Science_ by integrating all the data; epidemiological data is most persuasive
* David Baltimore, Nobel laureate retrovirologist, editorial in NEJM
* George Klein: Duesberg is a charlatan in disguise, uses expertise in one area to criticize and draw conclusions in another
* Duesberg's standard for causation is too high, he's being semantic and philosophical

Press
* Gay newspapers: New York Native, Christopher Street, Dispatches praised the research
* Radio, CNN, Spin Magazine gave Duesberg attention

President's (Reagan) Commission on the HIV Epidemic
* Let Duesberg testify in 1988
* Sharply criticized him

Duesberg's allies
* Didn't necessarily agree with him, but applauded the effort to push Science for better answers
* Robert Root-Bernstein, "multi-factorial synergistic theory"
* Jad Adams, _AIDS and the HIV Myth_
* Luc Montaginer, "HIV may have a cofactor"
* Shih-Ching Lo, AIDS Pathology Division of the Armed Forcces Institute of Pathology
* Bryan Ellison, cellular molecular biology PhD, Lo and Montaginer are trying to "fill the gaps" in the HIV theory, which is definitely wrong
* 50 scientists, including Kary Mullis, form The Group for Scientific Repraisal of the HIV/AIDS Hypothesis

AIDS Researcher allies:
* American Council on Science and Heath
* The broader scientific community
* John Maddox, editor of _Nature_

Conflict over styles of practice:

* Dunesberg: "laboratory style of practice"
    * Theory and observation are connected through the meshing together "mediating elements:" ideas, things, marks and their manipulation
    * Meshing of practice, beliefs, and tools are key to laboratory science
    * Lab science is extremely internally consistent
* AIDS Researchers: "epidemiological style of practice"
    * Epidemiologists create a mosiac of ideas, data, material, technology
    * Theories are verified between disiplines
    * It's a collective work that requires a lot of time and energy
    * It's a proceedure for finding things out
