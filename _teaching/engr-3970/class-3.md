## Active reflection exercise

* write one thing on the board you don't understand from the reading

---

## Announcements

---

## Review last week

* Technology is socially constructed
* History of Tech, "innovation studies", and existing sociology are fine but they aren't telling us much that's interesting or empirical
* SCOT is a way of adapting a successful methodology for studying scientific discovery (EPOR) to study how technologies develop
  * SCOT is multi-directional
  * Focus is on social groups, their problems, and the artifacts created to address thsoe problems
* Questions?

## Goals for this week

* Understand Paul David's argument for how we got (stuck with) QWERTY keyboards
* Understand the limits of descriptive analysis
* Have yet another framework for looking at innovation and technological acceptance

## Paul David, QWERTY, and historical accidents

* How many have *seen* a keyboard with a different layout?
* How many have *used* a keyboard with a different layout?
* How many have ever tried to persuade your friends and family that some other keyboard layout is superior?
* Did anybody know the story of QWERTY before this article?
* Why do we have QWERTY when Dvorak is clearly superior?
  * Why do we have QWERTY and not the 7 other keyboards that were invented in the early 20th Century?
  * Consipiracy of Big Typewriter?
  * Socilaization into acceptance of an antiquated tradition?
  * Burdensome government regulations keeping us down?
  * Failing public schools?
  * None of those things.
  * Even though we're free to choose to behave however we want, we're sometimes "held fast in the grip of events long forgotten and shaped by circumstances in which neither they nor their interests figured"
    * We're all free consumers, we live in a free market economy, yet sometimes decisions are made long before we enter the market that restrict our behavior
  * Christopher Latham Sholes, MKE, and fellow tinkerers Carlos Glidden and Samuel W. Soule invented the 57th typewriter.
  	* The called it "Type Writer" (two words)
  	* It was an elegant machine with a fatal problem: If you typed too fast, you'd jam up the machine
    * Keyboard design had to slow down typists and after sale to Remington, QWERTY was standardized as a sales gimmick: You could spell TYPEWRITER on one row.
    * Remington didn't succeed with this typewriter. 
      * Far from perfect technology
      * Launched an expensive product in a depression
      * Little marketshare, certainly not a stronghold
      * We could say the typebar and keyboard designs were in active controversy
        * DHIA TENSOR, the ball type sleeve, the cylindrical type sleeve
  * Eventually, the competition settled down, and settled on QWERTY
    * Typewriter operators, and the organizations who trained them: part of a larger system of production that was "nobody's design"
    * If you were sufficiently trained, you could "touch type"
    * Three features of touch typing caused QWERTY to become "locked-in"
      1. technical interrelatedness
      1. economies of scale
      1. quasi-irreversibility
* Technical interrelatedness
  * the need for system compatibility between keyboard "hardware" and the "software" represented by the touch typist's memory
  * purchasers of the hardware typically were business firms and therefore distinct from the owners of typing skills
  * Employers didn't have an interest to provide training but buying QWERTY typewriters ensured they could find good typists
  * They had to buy the hardware they could find software for, creating their own software was a non-starter
* Economies of scale, "system scale economies"
  * The market for touch typing training increased the availability of humans who could use the typewriters
  * A wealth of skills in using the system eventually lowered its overall cost
  * Suppose businesses *only* care about the size of the population of touch typists when deciding what typewriter to buy
  * Potential typists only care about the likelihood they'll end up with a job
  * Law of increasing returns:
    * Pull a ball out of an urn, if it's of a certain color, replace it otherwise, discard it.
    * Eventually you only have that one color of ball left
  * There became an expectation that typists would have QWERTY keyboards because that's what they'd be trained on
  * Remington's market was slim, but thanks to these expectations, was able to eventually take hold
* Technological lock-in, "quasi-irreversibility of investments"
  * High costs of software conversion
  * Businesses didn't care much about QWERTY, they cared about not retraining their typists â€” not replacing their software
  * The costs of software conversion were going down, but costs of hardware conversion were going up

## QWERTY Worlds

* What other QWERTY worlds exist out there?
  * By all economic or technical expectations, the QWERTY keyboard should have failed
  * Humans who used the product and parallel industries shaped the development

## Assignment: Reading response journals

* Weekly response to the readings
* I'll post the prompt before Wednesday
* Due before class the following Monday

### Grading

* Individual responses will be a completion grade: 
  * 10 points if:
    * You turn it in on time
    * It's clear you did the readings
    * You did collegiate level work
  * Otherwise it's a 0
  * 5 of these things, total of 50 possible points
  * I (or Tripp) might give you feedback, you do not need to revise
* Portfolio (50 points)
  * Assembled throughout the term; turned in *before the end of the final exam period*
  * 10 points: for having all the responses there
  * 20 points: reflection on your portfolio
	* Read the whole thing, reflect on what you noticed from your own writing
	* One or two paragraphs about which reading stuck out to you the most, what was most meaningful
  * 20 points:
	* Highlight one response you think is your best
	  * Paragrpah long explanation of why, how it reflects your best work
    * Highlight room for improvement on at least two others
