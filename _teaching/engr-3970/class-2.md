## Classmates bingo

As you saw last week, we're going to spend a lot of time talking to each other
We have a lot to do; but it's worth taking the time to get to know each other


* Distribute Bingo cards to each student.
* First to blackout wins

## Social Construction of Technology

We ended last week introducing the idea that science and technology were social activities
* Individuals do formal work
* Institutions enforce formalism
* Formalism and institutions reinforce each other and empower the science they create
* Example: If you want to prove the Earth is flat, you have to compete with the institutions that have reinforced the heliocentric theory for the last 475 years.
  * That competition is rhetorical, you have to show your methods and your findings are more sound than the settled science
  * It doesn't stop anybody from rejecting the science and facts, or making shit up (B.O.B., notorious flat earther https://twitter.com/bobatl/status/691411463051804676)

## Bijker and Pinch

* Technology studies has been three things:
  * Innovation studies: economists looking for the "conditions of success in innovation"
    * Problem: Arbitrary methods, didn't look at the content of the tech, but everything else
  * History of technology:
    * "Descriptive historiography is endemic in the field," that is, it's overly positivist.
    * Describe successful innovation, how it came to be from just about every angle, including the content of the tech
    * Problem: Overly focused on successful innovations, reinforces the notion that technological progress has been neat, orderly, linear
      * B&P use the "Bakelite" example: Bakelite -> Plastics. Real history is more complicated: phenol dumping in WWI, natural resins, semi-natural resins
    * History of Tech is still worthwhile, especially as it's evolved and expanded.
  * Sociology of Technology: We should be doing more than talking about how one technology replaces the last.
    * There's not much difference, that is, between history of tech and sociology of tech (in 1987)
    * Science discovers, tech applies is also wrong: A false or partly false theory could still generate useful knowledge for tech development
    * Truth of science ≠ successful technology
    * What makes for success in tech? Social construction.
    * We need methods

* EPOR and SCOT
  * Empirical Program of Relativism (EPOR) (Harry Collins)
  	* Stage one: Scientific findings are open to interpretation
  		* A "scientific consensus" usually emerges. Why?
	* Stage two: Social mechanisms limit the interpretive flexibility of findings
	* Stage three: Social forces in the rest of the world force acceptance of scientific consensus
	* Successful in science but unclear if it works for technology
  * Social Construction of Technology (SCOT)
    * Development of tech is "an alternation of variation and selection"
    * Multi-directional view allows for the possibility that unsuccessful technnology might have prevailed
    * Why should bother?
* Bikes
  * How did we get from the boneshaker to the modern bike?
  	* Linear way to look at it is to say: 1. Boneshaker, 2. Penny Farthing, 3. Lawson, 4. Modern bikes
  	* This ignores all the strange bicycles that were invented, gave people meaning, and ultimately shaped the modern bike
  	* Social groups have problems, or needs. All social groups concerned with a technology will be responsible for giving it meaning and direction
  	* Step one: Does the artifact have meaning at all? 
  	  * Obvs. bicyclists, but also "anticyclists" who would sabbotage cyclists
  	* Step two: Is the group homogenous?
  	  * Women had different meanings for the bicycle than men
  	  * Women were not meant to ride the Ordinary "Penny farthing" bicycle; that's what tricycles were for
  	  * Engineers and bike producers sought to make a bike "safe enough" for women to use
  	  Social groups so far: Cyclists, anti-cyclists, women cyclists, engineers, producers
  	* Step three: Describe your social groups
  	  * Ordinary riders, biking was "sporty and manly…and unlike other foolish crazes, it has not died out."
  	* Step four: Map the social groups to their problems, problems to their solutions
  	  * This brings out the conflicts embedded in the development of a tech
  	  * Solutions to problems become both technological and moral or judicial
  	* "Inventing" the bicycle took 19 years
  		* Most of that time few envisioned one specific "bicycle" let alone anything resembling the one we have now
  		* People, in social groups, argued for their preferred bi- or tricycles.
  * Technological artifacts have interpretive flexibility, just like scientific discoveries
    * Flexibility in design and in how people think about artifacts
    * Air tires on bicycles, for example
    	* Engineers: They'll never last. Too dangerous, interferes with symmetry, too inconvenient to keep air pressure calibrated, plus there's a better technical solution to the vibration problem
    	* These crazy bicycles stuck around even after better bikes were available
    	* Safety of the penny farthing led to the saddle moving back; then we had a bunch of different high-wheelers; some of them became less safe to appeal to "macho" men
  * Stabilization of the artifact
  	* As the artifact stabilizes, problems disappear
  		* One option, claim the bike is safe!
  		* Another: Redefine the problem.
  			* Attempt to appease the public and engineers: The air tire brings much needed levity to our daily routine
  			* Attempt to appease races: Show them how much faster it is by putting it on a racing bike
  			* Meaning was translated. Air tires are the answer to another, more important problem (for you)
  * Finally: Wider context, is the bike design settled? Have everybody's problems been settled once and for all?
* Foundational paper in Sociology of Science
  * Today's studies have this same focus on understanding how technologies shape and are shaped by real problems faced by social groups
    * Who is included in the development of the technology?
    * What social groups are excluded? What are their problems? Will they be addressed? How?
    * What other possibilities of technology might have been?
